AddFiles 3 (PyAddfiles) Manual

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

============

AddFiles is a simple utility for grouping photographs or other images together. 
It stores the groupings in a simple XML file that can be read by other applications.

Its main purpose is to allow you to create an HTML slideshow from these groups of 
images that can be viewed in a web browser.

It also has some basic image manipulation functionality, sucha as the ability to 
resize images to fit into the browser window.

This is version 3 and was written using Python and Tkinter. There was an older 
version 2 written in Visual Basic. Version 1 was a very simple C program that
was very different from the current version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Main Window

===============

The main window is divided into four areas:

1) The top-left area is the "File View" that shows image files in the current directory.

2) The top-right area is the "Preview" that shows the currently selected image.

3) The bottom-left area is the "Group view" that shows the currently selected group.

4) The bottom-right is the "Groups view" that shows a list of groups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Groups

======

The main premise of AddFiles is that all your images are collected into groups. 

Groups are shown in the "Groups"-list in the bottom right hand side of the main 
Window. When the program starts up initially there is only one group named "Default". 

To the right of the "Groups"-list is an "Add", "Remove" and "Rename" button.

You can add more groups by clicking the "Add" button.

You can remove groups by selecting them in the list and clicking the "Remove" button.

You can rename a group by selecting it in the list and clicking the "Rename" button.

Clicking the button labled "Up" to the left of the 'Groups' list moves the currently
selected groups up one position. Likewise, the button labled "Down" will move the
selected groups down one position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files and Directories

=====================

In the top left corner of the main window is the current directory view, which 
consists of a button showing the current directory and a list with all the image
files in that directory.

Clicking on the directory button shows a dialog that allows you to choose a new
directory. The file list will be updated accordingly.

Selecting an image file in the list shows it in the "Preview" view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group

=====

Below the directory view is the view of the current group. It contains a list of 
all the images in the current group and a couple of buttons.

Clicing the "Add" button above the list will add all files selected in the file
view to the current group.

Clicking the "Remove" button will remove all the files selected in the current group
view from the group.

Clicking the button labled "Up" to the right of the list moves the currently
selected files up one position. Likewise, the button labled "Down" will move the
selected files down one position.

Below the list are two buttons with a label 'Thumbnail'. The one to the left is 
used to set the image that is currently shown in the "Preview" as the thumbnail 
for the current group. It will display the name of the thumbnail file if one is
selected, otherwise it is labeled "None" if the group does not have a thumbnail
assigned. 

The other button is labled "Clear" and will unassign any thumbnail assigned to the
current group.

Thumbnails are generated from these images for the index.html file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects

========

Save your project by clicking on the "File" -> "Save" or "File" -> "Save As" 
menus. The first time you save or if you click "Save As" will prompt you for
a filename. The project can be opened at a later stage by clicking on the 
"File" -> "Open" menu and selecting the previously saved file.

You can start a new project by clicking on the "File" -> "New" menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Image Manipulation

==================

The program allows some manipulation of image files.

To the left of the "Preview" window are two buttons labled "Left" and "Right".
Clicking the "Left" button will rotate the currently previewed image 90 degrees 
counter clockwise. The "Right" button will rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise.

Below the preview window is a label showing the current size of the image in the
form "width x height". Next to it is a button "Resize to Fit" with two text 
boxes next to it: The one to the left is for the 'resize width' and to the right 
is for the 'resize height'. Clicking the "Resize to Fit" button will stretch or 
shrink the image to fit between the 'resize width' and the 'resize height'.

The aspect ratio of the image is maintained.

The "Resize to Fit" button will be highlighted in red if the current image's 
dimensions are is larger than the 'resize width' or 'resize height'.

Backups are always saved as the name of the original file appended with a '~'. 
Thus the backup of 'myphoto.jpg' is saved as 'myphoto.jpg~'. If a backup already
exists for a photo it will not be overwritten on the assumption that the existing
backup of the file is the original.

The "Tools" -> "Remove Backups" menu will delete all backup files in the current
directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Output

===========

Click on the "File" -> "Generate HTML" menu. You will be given a dialog wherein 
you should choose a folder where the HTML output should be placed. Clicking "OK"
wil result in an HTML slideshow being generated.

Each slide in the slideshow is a single photo in an HTML page with links to the 
next and previous photos in the group and next and previous groups in the series.

An 'index.html' file will also be generated that shows either the names or the 
thumbnails of all the groups in the series for easy access. Each slide also 
contains a link to get back to the 'index.html' file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration

=============

Click "File" -> "Configuration". This will bring up a dialog containing some 
configuration options.

You can set the default values of the 'resize width' and the 'resize height'
text fields here.

You can set the width and height of the thumbnails in the 'index.html' file, as
well as the number of thumbnails per row in 'index.html'.

You can set the values of the BGCOLOR (background colour), TEXT (text colour),
LINK (link text colour) and VLINK (visited link text colour) attributes of the
generated HTML as well. Clicking the buttons labled "..." next to each colour
brings up a dialog for choosing the colour.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Tools" menu

============

Under the tools menu
1a) Filter - Files that have been assigned to groups are removed from the "File View"
	so that the "File View" becomes less cluttered if you have to sift through 
	lots of files.
1b) unFilter - Disables the filtering. All files are shown in the "File View"
2) Remove Backups - When files are manipulated, the original is saved as its filename
	followed by a '~'. For example "foo.jpg", becomes "foo.jpg~". If a backup
	already exists, it won't be overwritten, ensuring that the backup file is always
	the original.
3) Wipe Groups - Deletes a group, and the files in it. The files are backed up before
	they're deleted, as described above.
4) Statistics - Presents statistics about the project: The number of groups and
	the number of images among those groups.
